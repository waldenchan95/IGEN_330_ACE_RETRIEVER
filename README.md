**Getting started with the Git**

**Robot Hardware Pins**

To ensure that our team has the same pins at all times for reduction of debugging here are the following pins that we have defined:
```cpp
const int RinB = 8;
const int RinF = 7;
const int LinB = 2;
const int LinF = 3;
const int conR = 6;
const int conL = 5;

// Right encoder pins
#define R_CLK 9
#define R_DT 10

// Left encoder pins
#define L_CLK 11
#define L_DT 12
```

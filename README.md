**Robot Hardware Pins**

To ensure that our team has the same pins at all times for reduction of debugging here are the following pins that we have defined:
```cpp

const int conR = 10;
const int conL = 9;
const int frequency = 150;
// Right encoder pins
#define R_CLK 9
#define R_DT 10

// Left encoder pins
#define L_CLK 11
#define L_DT 12
```
